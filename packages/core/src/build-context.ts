/**
 * @lessjs/core - Kiss Build Context
 *
 * Shared mutable state for all KISS Vite plugins.
 * Replaces the closure-captured variables (honoEntryCode, scannedIslandTagNames, etc.)
 * with a single object that's explicitly passed around.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Each build gets a fresh context (safe for concurrent builds / tests)
 * - Plugins read/write state through the same object (no hidden coupling)
 * - State is resettable (for testing and watch mode)
